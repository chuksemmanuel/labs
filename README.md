This is a playground for testing stuff across the stack ‚Äî from Frontend libraries to Backend frameworks, mobile apps with React Native and CLI scripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Purpose

- Try new libraries, tools, and architecture ideas
- Keep experiments isolated, low-stakes, and documented (kind of)
- Learn by doing, breaking, and rebuilding

## üìÇ Starter Templates

Each folder includes a minimal starter setup for its respective framework.

| Folder                | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [`Nextjs`](./nextjs/) | Next.js starter with the basics |

## üß™ Labs (Branches)

Labs live in branches and each explores a specific concept, tool, or pattern.
