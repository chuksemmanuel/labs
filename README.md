# labs 🧪

A playground for testing stuff across the full stack — from Frontend libraries to Backend frameworks, mobile apps with React Native and CLI scripts.

## 🛠️ Purpose

- Try new libraries, tools, and architecture ideas
- Keep experiments isolated, low-stakes, and documented (kind of)
- Learn by doing, breaking, and rebuilding
