# next-react-lab 🧪

A personal lab space for learning, testing, and prototyping with **Next.js**, **React**, and related libraries.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo serves as a launchpad for:

- Experimenting with new libraries and APIs
- Practicing React and Next.js architecture patterns
- Prototyping UI/UX interactions and performance optimizations

Each **experiment lives on its own branch** to keep things clean and isolated.
